# Solar-Tracking-And-Home-Automation
    1. Solar panel tracks the position of sun with the help of sensor and moves accordingly toward the maximum brightness direction to harvest maximum amount of solar energy
    
    2. Stores enegry in battery with the help of power management system
    
    3. Microcontrollers control the lights and fan of home via IoT. 
    
    4. Autolight dimming in day light
    
    5. Rain and wind protection of solar panel
    
    7. Auto light and fan off when no one is in room, using PIR sensor
    
    8. Mobile monitoring via IoT
